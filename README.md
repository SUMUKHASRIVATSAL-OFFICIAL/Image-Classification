# Image Classification

## Overview

This project is based on classification model that predicts whether an image belongs to the which category. The model processes images and classifies them accordingly, with a focus on recognizing animals such as lions, dogs, and cats ,or vehicles etc.

## Features

- Image preprocessing and normalization
- Deep learning-based image classification
- Supports multiple animal categories
- Can process base64-encoded images

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (depending on the model used)
- OpenCV (for image preprocessing)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/animal-classification.git
   cd animal-classification
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Download or prepare the dataset:
   ```sh
   mkdir dataset
   ```
   Place images in the dataset folder.

## Usage

### Running the Model

To classify an image, run:

```sh
python classify.py --image path/to/image.jpg
```

For base64 images:

```sh
python classify.py --base64 "image_base64_string"
```

### Example Code

```python
from model import classify_image
result = classify_image("path/to/image.jpg")
print(result)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Fixes

#### 1. **Incorrect Classification**

- Ensure the image is preprocessed correctly.
- Check if the model was trained on similar images.
- Try using a different threshold for classification.

#### 2. **Base64 Decoding Errors**

- Ensure the base64 string is correctly formatted.
- Try decoding and displaying the image before classification.

#### 3. **Model Not Found**

- Ensure the trained model file (`model.h5` or `model.pth`) exists in the project directory.
